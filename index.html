      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">multilingual mathematics tutor</strong> with an academic background shaped by the German School London. I graduated with <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">top honours</strong>, receiving both the <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">Mathematics Prize</strong> and the <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">Physics Prize</strong>, and achieving <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">14 and 13 points</strong> respectively in the German International Abitur — recognition that reflects my deep commitment to these subjects and the joy I find in mathematical thinking and physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now work with students across a wide range of levels in both <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">English and German</strong>, helping them <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">build confidence</strong>, <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">strengthen their foundations</strong>, and <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">develop clarity in their reasoning</strong>. My teaching style is <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">patient, structured, and adaptable</strong>, shaped by years of working closely with learners who each bring their own goals, challenges, and learning styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside tutoring, I enjoy playing handball and was selected in early 2025 for the <strong style="color:#3ecacb;">Great Britain U20 national team</strong>.

        <h2>What Parents and Students Say</h2>

        <div class="review-row">
            <div class="review-name">Parent, Years 9-10</div>
            <div class="review-text">
                <p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Marc as a mathematics tutor. As a classmate of our children, we know him as an approachable, open-minded, and determined young person who completes his tasks with great care and success. Marc impresses with his calm, patient nature and his ability to explain even complex mathematical concepts in a clear and structured way. We especially appreciate his personable manner — our child feels safe, respected, and motivated with him.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="review-row">
            <div class="review-name">Parent, Year 10</div>
            <div class="review-text">
                <p>Marc has been tutoring mathematics at the German School London since he was 14 — with great success. After his first student, all others came through recommendations and word of mouth. Marc is not only outstanding in mathematics (14 points in the Abitur and a special award from the department), but also has a talent for explaining complicated topics clearly and responding to his students' needs.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="review-row">
            <div class="review-name">Parent, Years 8-10</div>
            <div class="review-text">
                <p>We used Marc in Richmond/UK for maths tutoring at the German School London for our eldest son (Years 8–10). Marc's lessons significantly reduced pressure at home. Boys working with boys just works better! He conveyed the material very well in a friendly relationship, always radiated calm and composure, and was highly flexible with last-minute problems or tests. We could always rely on him — even with scheduling.</p>

            <div class="review-name">Student, Year 11</div>
            <div class="review-text">
                <p>He explains everything very well, prepares for each lesson, and plans ahead. He gives a bit of homework to ensure constant repetition.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="review-row">
            <div class="review-name">Parent, Years 5-9</div>
            <div class="review-text">
                <p>I'm so glad Marc has been helping my son with maths for four years! He inspires his students and teaches even complex topics in a simple way. And the improvement in grades was visible very quickly. I can recommend him without reservation.</p>
